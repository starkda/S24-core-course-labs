# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## 1. Caching Dependencies

- **Cache Dependencies:** Utilize caching mechanisms provided by CI/CD platforms to cache dependencies, such as Python
  packages, Node modules, or Maven artifacts. This reduces the time required for dependency installation in subsequent
  workflow runs, improving overall workflow efficiency.

## 2. Using Secrets

- **Secure Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and access tokens, securely
  using built-in secrets management features provided by CI/CD platforms. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the source code or
  configuration files to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

## 3. Pushing Images

- **Automated Docker Image Push:** Automate the process of building and pushing Docker images to a container registry as
  part of the CI workflow. Use Docker login actions and securely stored Docker credentials to authenticate with the
  container registry and push Docker images. This ensures that updated Docker images are available for deployment
  whenever changes are made to the codebase.

## 4. Using Linting

- **Code Linting:** Implement code linting as part of the CI pipeline to enforce coding standards and identify potential
  issues in the codebase. Use linters, such as Flake8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript, or RuboCop for Ruby, to analyze
  code for syntax errors, style violations, and other code quality issues. Incorporating code linting into the CI
  workflow helps maintain consistent code quality and improves overall code readability.
